    "The previous code is a configuration setup for a Python application using the `pydantic_settings` package (which is an extension of Pydantic, a popular data validation library). This setup allows you to define application settings in a structured way and load them from environment variables, typically stored in a `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing BaseSettings**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `BaseSettings` is a class provided by the `pydantic_settings` package. It is used to create settings classes that can read and validate environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining the `Settings` Class**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Settings(BaseSettings):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `Settings` class inherits from `BaseSettings`. This means that all the attributes defined in this class will be treated as settings that can be populated from environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Attributes of the `Settings` Class**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   DATABASE_HOST: str\n",
    "   DATABASE_NAME: str\n",
    "   DATABASE_USER: str\n",
    "   DATABASE_PASSWORD: str\n",
    "   DATABASE_PORT: int\n",
    "   app_name: str = \"Full Stack To Do App\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - These attributes represent the various configuration settings for the application.\n",
    "   - `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_NAME`, `DATABASE_USER`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, and `DATABASE_PORT` are expected to be strings and an integer, respectively. The values for these settings will be populated from environment variables.\n",
    "   - `app_name` is a string with a default value of `\"Full Stack To Do App\"`. If an environment variable for `app_name` is not provided, this default value will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inner `Config` Class**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Config:\n",
    "       env_file = \".env\"\n",
    "       extra = \"ignore\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The inner `Config` class is a special class used to configure how Pydantic (or `pydantic_settings` in this case) should behave.\n",
    "   - `env_file = \".env\"`:\n",
    "     - This tells Pydantic to load environment variables from a file named `.env`. This is useful in development and testing environments where you might not want to set environment variables globally on your system.\n",
    "   - `extra = \"ignore\"`:\n",
    "     - This setting tells Pydantic to ignore any extra environment variables that are present in the `.env` file or the environment but are not defined as attributes in the `Settings` class. This prevents errors from being raised if there are additional, unrelated environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of What This Code Does\n",
    "- The `Settings` class defines a structure for the application’s configuration, which includes database connection details and an application name.\n",
    "- It loads these settings from environment variables, defaulting to values defined in a `.env` file.\n",
    "- The `Config` class customizes this behavior, ensuring that only the defined settings are loaded and that any extra variables are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps centralize and manage configuration settings in a clean and maintainable way, making it easy to adjust settings for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production)."

    "The code in `main.py` is a basic setup for a FastAPI application, which is a web framework for building APIs in Python. Here's a simple explanation of what each part of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Importing Necessary Modules and Functions**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from functools import lru_cache\n",
    "   from typing import Union\n",
    "   from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends\n",
    "   from fastapi.responses import PlainTextResponse\n",
    "   from starlette.exceptions import HTTPException as StarletteHTTPException\n",
    "   from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n",
    "   import config\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`lru_cache`**: This is a decorator that caches the results of a function so that if it's called again with the same arguments, it returns the cached result instead of recomputing it. This is used to cache configuration settings.\n",
    "   - **`Union`**: This is a type hint from the `typing` module that indicates a value can be one of several types (e.g., `int` or `None`).\n",
    "   - **`FastAPI`, `Depends`, `PlainTextResponse`, `HTTPException`, `CORSMiddleware`**: These are utilities and classes from FastAPI and Starlette (which FastAPI is built on). They help set up the web application, handle dependencies, return text responses, manage HTTP exceptions, and enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).\n",
    "   - **`config`**: This is the module where the application's settings are defined (like database credentials).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Creating the FastAPI App**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   app = FastAPI()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This creates an instance of a FastAPI application, which will handle incoming HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Including Routers (Initially commented Out)**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # router: comment out next line till create it\n",
    "   app.include_router(todos.router)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The code includes a router from a module called `todos`, which likely contains specific routes (endpoints) related to \"to-do\" items. **This line will be commented out until the router is created**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **CORS Middleware Configuration**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   app.add_middleware(\n",
    "       CORSMiddleware,\n",
    "       allow_origins=[\"*\"],\n",
    "       allow_credentials=True,\n",
    "       allow_methods=[\"*\"],\n",
    "       allow_headers=[\"*\"],\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This adds middleware to the app that allows any domain (origin) to interact with your API, which is important during development when your frontend might be hosted on a different domain. The `allow_origins=[\"*\"]` line allows requests from any domain, and the other parameters allow various HTTP methods and headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CORS Middleware Configuration Explained**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code configures something called **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in a FastAPI application. Let's break it down in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is CORS?**\n",
    "- **CORS** is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web pages can request resources (like data) from a different domain (website) than the one that served the web page.\n",
    "- For example, if your frontend app (say, running on `http://localhost:3000`) needs to make a request to your API running on `http://localhost:8000`, CORS rules determine if this is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Does This Code Do?**\n",
    "1. **Adding Middleware**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   app.add_middleware(\n",
    "       CORSMiddleware,\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Middleware is like a middleman that intercepts and processes incoming requests before they reach your app's routes.\n",
    "   - `CORSMiddleware` is a specific type of middleware that handles CORS rules, deciding whether to allow or block requests coming from different domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Allowing All Origins**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   allow_origins=[\"*\"],\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `allow_origins=[\"*\"]` means the API is configured to accept requests from **any domain**. This is useful during development when your frontend (UI) and backend (API) might be running on different servers or ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Credentials**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   allow_credentials=True,\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This allows requests to include credentials like cookies or authentication tokens. It's necessary when your frontend needs to send or receive sensitive data securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Allowing All Methods**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   allow_methods=[\"*\"],\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `allow_methods=[\"*\"]` means the API will accept **any HTTP method** (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). This flexibility is useful during development to ensure all types of requests are permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Allowing All Headers**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   allow_headers=[\"*\"],\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `allow_headers=[\"*\"]` means the API will accept requests with **any headers**. Headers often contain important information like content types (JSON, HTML) or authorization tokens, so allowing all headers ensures nothing is blocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is This Important?**\n",
    "- **Development Convenience**: During development, your frontend and backend might run on different servers (e.g., localhost on different ports). Without proper CORS settings, your browser might block requests between them. This configuration avoids that problem by allowing everything.\n",
    "- **Security Note**: While allowing everything is fine during development, it's important to tighten these settings in production to only allow trusted domains, methods, and headers to ensure security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "This code configures your FastAPI app to accept requests from any domain, using any method and headers, and to include credentials. This is very flexible and convenient during development, but should be more restrictive in a production environment for security reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Global HTTP Exception Handler**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   @app.exception_handler(StarletteHTTPException)\n",
    "   async def http_exception_handler(request, exc):\n",
    "       print(f\"{repr(exc)}\")\n",
    "       return PlainTextResponse(str(exc.detail), status_code=exc.status_code)\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "What we now have in this file is an Alembic migration script, which is used to manage changes to your database schema. This specific code defines how to create and, if necessary, undo (drop) a table called `todos` in the database. Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Imports**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from typing import Sequence, Union\n",
    "   from alembic import op\n",
    "   import sqlalchemy as sa\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`typing`**: This is used for type hinting, helping you specify what types of variables can be.\n",
    "   - **`alembic.op`**: This provides operations (like `execute`, `create_table`, etc.) that Alembic can perform on the database.\n",
    "   - **`sqlalchemy`**: Though imported here, it isn't directly used in this script. It's commonly used in migration scripts to define database schema elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Revision Identifiers**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   revision: str = '0f7c25a67c73'\n",
    "   down_revision: Union[str, None] = None\n",
    "   branch_labels: Union[str, Sequence[str], None] = None\n",
    "   depends_on: Union[str, Sequence[str], None] = None\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`revision`**: A unique identifier for this migration. Alembic uses this to track the migration.\n",
    "   - **`down_revision`**: This indicates the previous migration that this one depends on. `None` means this is either the first migration or not dependent on a previous one.\n",
    "   - **`branch_labels`** and **`depends_on`**: These are used for more complex migration setups, like branching and dependencies. They’re not used in this basic migration, hence set to `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`upgrade()` Function**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def upgrade():\n",
    "       op.execute(\"\"\"\n",
    "       create table todos(\n",
    "           id bigserial primary key,\n",
    "           name text,\n",
    "           completed boolean not null default false\n",
    "       )\n",
    "       \"\"\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `upgrade()` function is where you define what changes should be made to the database when applying this migration.\n",
    "   - **Inside `upgrade()`**:\n",
    "     - **`op.execute(...)`**: Runs raw SQL commands.\n",
    "     - The SQL command inside creates a new table called `todos` with three columns:\n",
    "       - **`id bigserial primary key`**: A unique identifier for each row, automatically incremented by the database (`bigserial` is a large integer type that auto-increments).\n",
    "       - **`name text`**: A text column for storing the name of the to-do item.\n",
    "       - **`completed boolean not null default false`**: A boolean column to indicate whether the to-do item is completed, with a default value of `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **`downgrade()` Function**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def downgrade():\n",
    "       op.execute(\"drop table todos;\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `downgrade()` function defines what should happen if you need to undo this migration.\n",
    "   - **Inside `downgrade()`**:\n",
    "     - **`op.execute(\"drop table todos;\")`**: Runs a raw SQL command to delete (drop) the `todos` table. This undoes the `upgrade()` function’s changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "- **`upgrade()`**: Creates a `todos` table with an auto-incrementing `id`, a `name` field, and a `completed` field (which defaults to `false`).\n",
    "- **`downgrade()`**: Removes the `todos` table if the migration needs to be reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code ensures that the database schema can be updated (or rolled back) consistently as your application evolves."

    "This code in the `schema.py` file defines the structure of the data used in your application, specifically for working with \"to-do\" items. It uses Pydantic, a library in Python that helps validate and serialize data. Let’s break down what each part does:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Importing `BaseModel` from Pydantic**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This imports `BaseModel`, which is the base class provided by Pydantic. You use `BaseModel` to define data models that automatically handle data validation and serialization (converting Python objects to JSON and vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Defining the `ToDoRequest` Class**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class ToDoRequest(BaseModel):\n",
    "       name: str\n",
    "       completed: bool\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This class defines the structure of data when a new \"to-do\" item is created or updated.\n",
    "   - **Fields**:\n",
    "     - `name: str`: This indicates that every \"to-do\" item must have a `name`, which is a string.\n",
    "     - `completed: bool`: This indicates whether the \"to-do\" item is completed or not, which is a boolean (`True` or `False`).\n",
    "   - **In simple terms**: `ToDoRequest` is a blueprint for the data you send to the server when you want to create or update a \"to-do\" item.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Defining the `ToDoResponse` Class**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class ToDoResponse(BaseModel):\n",
    "       name: str\n",
    "       completed: bool\n",
    "       id: int\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This class defines the structure of data when a \"to-do\" item is sent back from the server, like when you retrieve a \"to-do\" item from the database.\n",
    "   - **Fields**:\n",
    "     - `name: str`: The name of the \"to-do\" item.\n",
    "     - `completed: bool`: Indicates whether the \"to-do\" item is completed.\n",
    "     - `id: int`: A unique identifier for the \"to-do\" item, which is typically generated by the database.\n",
    "   - **In simple terms**: `ToDoResponse` is a blueprint for the data you receive from the server when retrieving or displaying a \"to-do\" item.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Using `orm_mode` in `ToDoResponse`**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Config:\n",
    "       orm_mode = True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: The `Config` class with `orm_mode = True` is a special configuration for the `ToDoResponse` class.\n",
    "   - **In simple terms**: By setting `orm_mode` to `True`, Pydantic allows the `ToDoResponse` class to work smoothly with data that comes from an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) like SQLAlchemy. This means you can pass SQLAlchemy models directly to the `ToDoResponse` class, and Pydantic will know how to convert them into the `ToDoResponse` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dive deeper into what ORM and SQLAlchemy are and how they relate to the `orm_mode` setting in Pydantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible systems—in this case, between a relational database and an object-oriented programming language like Python.\n",
    "- **Relational Databases**: Store data in tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity (like users, orders, or to-do items), and relationships between these entities are maintained using keys.\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented Programming**: In Python, we often work with classes and objects. For instance, you might have a `ToDo` class where each instance represents a single \"to-do\" item.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How ORMs Work:\n",
    "- An ORM maps database tables to Python classes. Each row in a table corresponds to an instance of a Python class, and each column in that row corresponds to an attribute of that class.\n",
    "- For example, if you have a `todos` table in your database, an ORM would allow you to interact with this table using a `ToDo` class in Python. You can create, read, update, and delete records in the table by interacting with instances of the `ToDo` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is SQLAlchemy?\n",
    "- **SQLAlchemy** is one of the most popular ORMs for Python. It allows you to work with databases using Python classes and objects instead of writing raw SQL queries.\n",
    "- SQLAlchemy provides tools to define Python classes that are mapped to database tables. These classes are known as **models**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For example, consider the following SQLAlchemy model:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean\n",
    "  from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n",
    "\n",
    "  Base = declarative_base()\n",
    "\n",
    "  class ToDoModel(Base):\n",
    "      __tablename__ = 'todos'\n",
    "      \n",
    "      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "      name = Column(String)\n",
    "      completed = Column(Boolean, default=False)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - Here, `ToDoModel` is a Python class that represents the `todos` table in your database.\n",
    "  - Each instance of `ToDoModel` corresponds to a row in the `todos` table.\n",
    "  - SQLAlchemy allows you to interact with the `todos` table using this model. You can create new to-do items, query existing ones, update them, or delete them using Python code rather than SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How `orm_mode` in Pydantic Relates to SQLAlchemy and ORMs:\n",
    "- **Pydantic** is a data validation library that ensures data structures are well-defined and validated before they’re used in your application.\n",
    "- When you use Pydantic with SQLAlchemy (or any ORM), you often want to convert database models into Pydantic models (schemas) for use in API responses. This is where `orm_mode` comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `orm_mode = True` in Pydantic:\n",
    "- **Without `orm_mode`**: Pydantic expects that data passed to it is in the form of standard Python types like dictionaries, lists, etc. If you pass an SQLAlchemy model instance directly to a Pydantic model, it might not know how to extract the data because the model instance isn’t a plain Python dictionary—it’s an object with methods and special attributes.\n",
    "- **With `orm_mode = True`**: Pydantic understands that it might be dealing with ORM models and knows how to extract the data from these objects. This allows you to pass SQLAlchemy model instances directly to Pydantic models, and Pydantic will correctly convert them into the expected format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "- If you have a `ToDoModel` instance (from SQLAlchemy), setting `orm_mode = True` in the Pydantic model allows you to easily convert it to a `ToDoResponse`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "\n",
    "  class ToDoResponse(BaseModel):\n",
    "      name: str\n",
    "      completed: bool\n",
    "      id: int\n",
    "\n",
    "      class Config:\n",
    "          orm_mode = True\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Assuming todo_instance is an instance of ToDoModel from SQLAlchemy\n",
    "  todo_response = ToDoResponse.from_orm(todo_instance)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `todo_response` is now an instance of `ToDoResponse`, populated with data from the `todo_instance` of `ToDoModel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "- **`ToDoRequest`**: Defines what data you need to provide when creating or updating a \"to-do\" item (name and completed status).\n",
    "- **`ToDoResponse`**: Defines what data you get back when retrieving a \"to-do\" item (name, completed status, and ID).\n",
    "- **`orm_mode`**: Allows the `ToDoResponse` class to easily convert ORM objects (like database records) into the response format.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure helps ensure that data is correctly formatted and validated throughout your application, whether it's being sent to or received from the server."

    "This code in the `database.py` file sets up the connection to a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool in Python. Let’s break down what each part of the code does:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Importing Necessary Modules**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import os\n",
    "   from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n",
    "   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n",
    "   from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n",
    "   from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`os`**: This module provides a way to interact with the operating system, particularly for accessing environment variables.\n",
    "   - **`sqlalchemy`**: This is the main package for SQLAlchemy, which is used to connect to and interact with the database.\n",
    "   - **`load_dotenv`**: A function from the `dotenv` package that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Loading Environment Variables**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   load_dotenv()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This line loads environment variables from a `.env` file. These variables typically include sensitive information like database credentials (username, password) that you don’t want to hard-code directly into your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Retrieving Database Credentials from Environment Variables**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   user = os.environ['DATABASE_USER']\n",
    "   password = os.environ['DATABASE_PASSWORD']\n",
    "   host = os.environ['DATABASE_HOST']\n",
    "   port = os.environ['DATABASE_PORT']\n",
    "   db_name = os.environ['DATABASE_NAME']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: These lines retrieve the database connection details (like username, password, host, port, and database name) from the environment variables that were loaded. These values are stored in variables that will be used to build the database connection string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Constructing the Database URL**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = f\"postgresql://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db_name}\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This line constructs the database connection URL, which tells SQLAlchemy how to connect to the PostgreSQL database. It uses the values retrieved from the environment variables to create a URL in the format:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     postgresql://username:password@host:port/db_name\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **In simple terms**: This URL is like the address SQLAlchemy will use to find and connect to your specific database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Creating the Database Engine**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   engine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: The `create_engine` function creates an **engine**. The engine is responsible for managing the connection to the database. It’s the starting point for any interaction with the database using SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Setting Up a Session**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This line creates a **session factory**. A session in SQLAlchemy is used to manage transactions, allowing you to query the database and save changes. `SessionLocal` is a factory that produces session instances when needed.\n",
    "   - **`autocommit=False`**: Ensures that transactions are not automatically committed to the database; you need to explicitly commit them.\n",
    "   - **`autoflush=False`**: Prevents automatic flushing of changes to the database until you commit.\n",
    "   - **`bind=engine`**: Ties the session to the database engine you created earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Defining the Base Class for Models**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   Base = declarative_base()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This line creates a base class called `Base` that your SQLAlchemy models will inherit from. This class includes all the necessary functionality to map Python classes to database tables.\n",
    "   - **In simple terms**: `Base` is like the blueprint that all your database models will use to define what the database tables should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary**:\n",
    "1. **Loads Environment Variables**: Using `load_dotenv()`, it loads database credentials from a `.env` file.\n",
    "2. **Constructs a Database URL**: Builds the connection string using these credentials.\n",
    "3. **Creates a Database Engine**: Sets up the engine that will connect to the database.\n",
    "4. **Sets Up a Session Factory**: Defines how to create sessions to interact with the database.\n",
    "5. **Defines a Base Class for Models**: Provides a base class for creating database tables using SQLAlchemy models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is essential for any application that needs to interact with a database, allowing you to easily query, update, and manage your database using Python code."

    "   - **`sqlalchemy` Imports**: These are the building blocks for defining the columns (fields) in your database table.\n",
    "     - **`Boolean`**: Used to store `True` or `False` values.\n",
    "     - **`Column`**: A function that defines a column in the database table.\n",
    "     - **`ForeignKey`**: Used to create a link between two tables (not used in this specific code).\n",
    "     - **`Integer`**: Used to store integer numbers.\n",
    "     - **`String`**: Used to store text strings.\n",
    "   - **`relationship`**: This is used to define relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-many or many-to-many). It’s not used directly in this code snippet but is typically imported for more complex models.\n",
    "   - **`Base`**: Imported from your `database.py` file, it’s the base class that all your models will inherit from. This class ties the model to the SQLAlchemy ORM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Defining the `ToDo` Class**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class ToDo(Base):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This class defines a \"to-do\" item in your database. By inheriting from `Base`, it becomes an SQLAlchemy model, which means it will be mapped to a table in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Setting the Table Name**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   __tablename__ = \"todos\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This sets the name of the table in the database to `\"todos\"`. This means that when SQLAlchemy creates the table for this model, it will name it `todos`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Defining Columns (Fields) in the Table**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n",
    "   name = Column(String)\n",
    "   completed = Column(Boolean, default=False)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)`**:\n",
    "     - **`id`**: This defines a column called `id` in the `todos` table.\n",
    "     - **`Integer`**: The `id` column will store integer numbers.\n",
    "     - **`primary_key=True`**: This makes the `id` column the primary key of the table, meaning each row will have a unique `id`.\n",
    "     - **`index=True`**: This creates an index on the `id` column, making lookups faster.\n",
    "   - **`name = Column(String)`**:\n",
    "     - **`name`**: This defines a column called `name` in the `todos` table.\n",
    "     - **`String`**: The `name` column will store text strings (e.g., the name of the to-do item).\n",
    "   - **`completed = Column(Boolean, default=False)`**:\n",
    "     - **`completed`**: This defines a column called `completed` in the `todos` table.\n",
    "     - **`Boolean`**: The `completed` column will store `True` or `False` values.\n",
    "     - **`default=False`**: If no value is provided when a new \"to-do\" item is created, this column will automatically be set to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- **`ToDo` class**: Represents a \"to-do\" item in your application.\n",
    "- **`__tablename__ = \"todos\"`**: Names the database table as `todos`.\n",
    "- **Columns**:\n",
    "  - **`id`**: A unique identifier for each \"to-do\" item (primary key).\n",
    "  - **`name`**: The name or description of the \"to-do\" item.\n",
    "  - **`completed`**: A boolean flag indicating whether the \"to-do\" item is completed or not, defaulting to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Simple Terms:\n",
    "This code defines the structure of a \"to-do\" item in the database. Each \"to-do\" has an `id` (a unique number), a `name` (the task or item name), and a `completed` status (whether it's done or not). This structure will be used to create a table in your database where all your \"to-do\" items will be stored."

    "The code in `crud.py` defines a set of functions that handle the core operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete - CRUD) for managing \"to-do\" items in a database using SQLAlchemy. Let's break down what each function does in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Imports and Setup**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from sqlalchemy.orm import Session\n",
    "   import models, schemas\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`Session`**: Represents a database session, which is used to interact with the database.\n",
    "   - **`models`**: Contains the SQLAlchemy models, which map to the database tables (in this case, the `ToDo` model).\n",
    "   - **`schemas`**: Contains the Pydantic schemas, which define the structure of the data being passed around (like `ToDoRequest`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Create a To-Do Item**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def create_todo(db: Session, todo: schemas.ToDoRequest):\n",
    "       db_todo = models.ToDo(name=todo.name, completed=todo.completed)\n",

    "       db.refresh(db_todo)\n",
    "       return db_todo\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Adds a new \"to-do\" item to the database.\n",
    "   - **How it works**:\n",
    "     1. **Create a `ToDo` object**: Converts the `ToDoRequest` schema (which contains the name and completed status) into a `ToDo` model object.\n",
    "     2. **Add to database**: Adds this new object to the database session.\n",
    "     3. **Commit the transaction**: Saves the changes to the database.\n",
    "     4. **Refresh**: Updates the `db_todo` object with any new data (like the auto-generated `id`).\n",
    "     5. **Return**: Returns the newly created `ToDo` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Read All To-Do Items**:\n",

    "           return db.query(models.ToDo).filter(models.ToDo.completed == completed).all()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Retrieves all \"to-do\" items from the database, optionally filtering by their completed status.\n",
    "   - **How it works**:\n",
    "     1. **No Filter**: If `completed` is `None`, return all \"to-do\" items.\n",
    "     2. **With Filter**: If `completed` is `True` or `False`, filter the results to return only those that match the given completed status.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Read a Single To-Do Item by ID**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def read_todo(db: Session, id: int):\n",
    "       return db.query(models.ToDo).filter(models.ToDo.id == id).first()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Retrieves a single \"to-do\" item from the database by its `id`.\n",
    "   - **How it works**:\n",
    "     1. **Query by ID**: Finds the first \"to-do\" item that matches the given `id`.\n",
    "     2. **Return**: Returns the found \"to-do\" item (or `None` if no such item exists).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Delete a To-Do Item**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def delete_todo(db: Session, id: int):\n",

    "   - **`List`**: Used to specify that a function will return a list of items.\n",
    "   - **`Session`**: Represents a database session used to interact with the database.\n",
    "   - **`APIRouter`**: A FastAPI tool for creating modular groups of routes.\n",
    "   - **`Depends`**: Used for dependency injection, which allows functions to receive required dependencies automatically.\n",
    "   - **`HTTPException`**: Used to raise HTTP errors, like 404 Not Found.\n",
    "   - **`status`**: Contains HTTP status codes for readability.\n",

    "   import Layout from '../components/layout';\n",
    "   import ToDoList from '../components/todo-list';\n",

    "   - **`Layout`**: This is a custom component (imported from `../components/layout`) that likely provides a consistent layout or structure for the page, such as a header, footer, or navigation.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Returning the JSX (HTML Structure)**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   return (\n",
    "     <div className={styles.layout}>\n",
    "       <h1 className={styles.title}>To Do</h1>\n",
    "       {props.children}\n",
    "     </div>\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`<div className={styles.layout}>`**: This creates a `<div>` element with a CSS class of `layout` applied to it. The class is defined in the imported `layout.module.css` file.\n",
    "   - **`<h1 className={styles.title}>To Do</h1>`**: This creates an `<h1>` heading element that says \"To Do\". The `title` class from the CSS file is applied to style this heading.\n",
    "   - **`{props.children}`**: This is a special React feature that allows the `Layout` component to display whatever is passed inside it when it is used. For example, if you wrap another component inside `Layout`, that component will be placed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It looks very similar to HTML but is actually a way to describe what the UI should look like using JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points About JSX:\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTML-like Syntax in JavaScript**:\n",
    "   - JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript. This makes it easier to describe the structure of your user interface.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```jsx\n",
    "     const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - In this example, `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>` looks like HTML, but it's actually JSX.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combining Logic and UI**:\n",
    "   - With JSX, you can embed JavaScript expressions directly within the UI structure. This means you can write dynamic, data-driven UI components easily.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```jsx\n",
    "     const name = \"Alice\";\n",
    "     const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Here, `{name}` is a JavaScript expression that gets evaluated and inserted into the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSX Compiles to JavaScript**:\n",
    "   - Under the hood, JSX is not valid JavaScript by itself. It gets compiled or transformed into regular JavaScript function calls (typically `React.createElement`) that the browser can understand.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```jsx\n",
    "     const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - This gets transformed into something like:\n",
    "     ```javascript\n",
    "     const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy to Read and Write**:\n",
    "   - JSX makes it easier to visualize the structure of the UI because it closely resembles HTML. This helps developers understand what the UI will look like just by reading the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Simple Terms:\n",
    "- **JSX** is a special syntax that looks like HTML but is used in JavaScript files (especially with React) to define what the user interface should look like.\n",
    "- It lets you write HTML-like code within your JavaScript, making it easier to create dynamic and interactive UIs.\n",
    "- While it looks like HTML, it's actually transformed into JavaScript code that browsers can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSX helps bridge the gap between the design of the UI and the logic that controls it, making it a powerful tool in modern web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Exporting the `Layout` Component**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   export default function Layout(props)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What it does**: This line exports the `Layout` component so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- **Styles**: Custom CSS classes (`layout` and `title`) are imported to style the elements within this component.\n",
    "- **`Layout` Component**: \n",
    "  - Provides a consistent layout with a title (\"To Do\").\n",
    "  - Wraps and displays any content or components passed inside it (`props.children`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "When you use the `Layout` component elsewhere in your app, it will display a styled \"To Do\" heading and whatever content you place inside it. This helps to ensure that pages or sections of your app have a consistent look and feel."

    "Let's break down this `components/todo-list.js` code in simple terms, explaining what each part does for someone who doesn't know how to code. This code is part of a to-do list app, which allows you to add, update, delete, and filter tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Setting Up the Basics**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   import styles from '../styles/todo-list.module.css'\n",
    "   import { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef } from 'react'\n",
    "   import { debounce } from 'lodash'\n",
    "   import ToDo from './todo'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**: \n",
    "     - The code is importing some tools and styles that help create and manage the to-do list.\n",
    "     - `styles`: This is for styling the list so it looks nice.\n",
    "     - `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useRef`: These are tools (called hooks) that help keep track of the list of tasks, what’s typed in the input box, and when things need to update.\n",
    "     - `debounce`: This tool is used to delay certain actions, like updating a task, to avoid doing it too quickly or too often.\n",
    "     - `ToDo`: This is a smaller part of the app that deals with individual tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Setting Up the State**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   const [todos, setTodos] = useState(null)\n",
    "   const [mainInput, setMainInput] = useState('')\n",
    "   const [filter, setFilter] = useState()\n",
    "   const didFetchRef = useRef(false)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**:\n",
    "     - `todos`: This keeps track of all the tasks (to-dos).\n",
    "     - `mainInput`: This keeps track of what you type in the box where you add new tasks.\n",
    "     - `filter`: This keeps track of whether you want to see all tasks, just the ones that are done, or just the ones that aren’t done.\n",
    "     - `didFetchRef`: This helps make sure that the tasks are fetched (loaded) only once when the app starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Loading the Tasks**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   useEffect(() => {\n",
    "     if (didFetchRef.current === false) {\n",
    "       didFetchRef.current = true\n",
    "       fetchTodos()\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }, [])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**: \n",
    "     - When the app first loads, it fetches (loads) the tasks from the server. The `useEffect` makes sure this happens only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Fetching (Loading) the Tasks**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   async function fetchTodos(completed) {\n",
    "     let path = '/todos'\n",
    "     if (completed !== undefined) {\n",
    "       path = `/todos?completed=${completed}`\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     const res = await fetch(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL + path)\n",
    "     const json = await res.json()\n",
    "     setTodos(json)\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**: \n",
    "     - It asks the server for the list of tasks and updates the app with the tasks it gets back.\n",
    "     - If you want to see only completed or active (not completed) tasks, it adjusts what it asks for accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Handling Changes to Tasks**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   const debouncedUpdateTodo = useCallback(debounce(updateTodo, 500), [])\n",
    "\n",
    "   function handleToDoChange(e, id) {\n",
    "     const target = e.target\n",
    "     const value = target.type === 'checkbox' ? target.checked : target.value\n",
    "     const name = target.name\n",
    "     const copy = [...todos]\n",
    "     const idx = todos.findIndex((todo) => todo.id === id)\n",
    "     const changedToDo = {\n",
    "       ...todos[idx],\n",
    "       [name]: value\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     copy[idx] = changedToDo\n",
    "     debouncedUpdateTodo(changedToDo)\n",
    "     setTodos(copy)\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**: \n",
    "     - When you change a task (like checking it off as done or editing its name), this updates the task in the list.\n",
    "     - It uses `debouncedUpdateTodo` to avoid making updates too quickly, only doing so after you stop making changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Updating a Task**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   async function updateTodo(todo) {\n",
    "     const data = {\n",
    "       name: todo.name,\n",
    "       completed: todo.completed\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     const res = await fetch(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL + `/todos/${todo.id}`, {\n",
    "       method: 'PUT',\n",
    "       body: JSON.stringify(data),\n",
    "       headers: {\n",
    "         'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n",
    "       }\n",
    "     })\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**: \n",
    "     - When you make changes to a task (like marking it as done), this sends the updated task to the server to save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Adding a New Task**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   async function addToDo(name) {\n",
    "     const res = await fetch(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL + `/todos/`, {\n",
    "       method: 'POST',\n",
    "       body: JSON.stringify({\n",
    "         name: name,\n",
    "         completed: false\n",
    "       }),\n",
    "       headers: {\n",
    "         'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n",
    "       }\n",

    "     if (res.ok) {\n",
    "       const json = await res.json();\n",
    "       const copy = [...todos, json]\n",
    "       setTodos(copy)\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**: \n",
    "     - When you type in a new task and hit \"Enter,\" this sends the new task to the server, adds it to the list, and shows it on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Deleting a Task**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   async function handleDeleteToDo(id) {\n",
    "     const res = await fetch(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL + `/todos/${id}`, {\n",
    "       method: 'DELETE',\n",
    "       headers: {\n",
    "         'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n",
    "       }\n",
    "     })\n",
    "     if (res.ok) {\n",
    "       const idx = todos.findIndex((todo) => todo.id === id)\n",
    "       const copy = [...todos]\n",
    "       copy.splice(idx, 1)\n",
    "       setTodos(copy)\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**: \n",
    "     - When you delete a task, this sends a request to the server to remove it and then updates the list on the screen to reflect that it’s gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **Handling Input Changes and Enter Key Press**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   function handleMainInputChange(e) {\n",
    "     setMainInput(e.target.value)\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   function handleKeyDown(e) {\n",
    "     if (e.key === 'Enter') {\n",
    "       if (mainInput.length > 0) {\n",
    "         addToDo(mainInput)\n",
    "         setMainInput('')\n",
    "       }\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**: \n",
    "     - `handleMainInputChange`: Updates what you type in the box for adding a new task.\n",
    "     - `handleKeyDown`: If you press \"Enter,\" it adds the new task if you’ve typed something.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. **Filtering Tasks**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   function handleFilterChange(value) {\n",
    "     setFilter(value)\n",
    "     fetchTodos(value)\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**: \n",
    "     - This allows you to filter tasks to see all, only active (not done), or only completed tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11. **Displaying Everything on the Screen**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   return (\n",
    "     <div className={styles.container}>\n",
    "       <div className={styles.mainInputContainer}>\n",
    "         <input className={styles.mainInput} placeholder=\"What needs to be done?\" value={mainInput} onChange={(e) => handleMainInputChange(e)} onKeyDown={handleKeyDown}></input>\n",

    "   import Image from 'next/image'\n",
    "   import styles from '../styles/todo.module.css'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **What this does**:\n",
    "     - **`Image`**: This is used to display images, like the delete button icon.\n",
    "     - **`styles`**: This imports custom styles from a CSS file to make the task look nice on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Defining the `ToDo` Component**:\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   export default function ToDo(props) {\n",
    "     const { todo, onChange, onDelete } = props;\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "     - **`ToDo`**: This is a function that creates a small piece of the app that represents one task.\n",
    "     - **`props`**: This allows the component to receive information from the parent component (like the task details and functions for editing or deleting).\n",
    "     - **`todo`**: Contains the details of the task (like its name and whether it's completed).\n",
    "     - **`onChange`**: A function that handles changes to the task (like checking it off or editing its name).\n",
    "     - **`onDelete`**: A function that deletes the task.\n",
    "\n",

    "     - **`<button>`**: This is a button that you can click to delete the task.\n",
    "     - **`onClick={() => onDelete(todo.id)}`**: When you click the button, it triggers the `onDelete` function to remove the task from the list.\n",
    "     - **`<Image>`**: This displays a small trash can icon inside the button to visually indicate that this button is for deleting the task.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - **`text-align: center;`**: This centers the text inside the element horizontally, making it look nicely aligned in the middle.\n",
    "   - **`font-size: 24px;`**: This sets the size of the text to 24 pixels, making it larger and more noticeable.\n",
    "   - **`margin: 10px;`**: This adds 10 pixels of space around the outside of the element. This space helps position the title away from other elements around it.\n",

    "This code in the `styles/todo-list.module.css` file is responsible for styling different parts of your to-do list app. Each section of the code applies specific styles to various parts of the user interface, making it look organized and easy to use. Let's go through what each part does in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Styling the Main Container**:\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   .container {\n",
    "       width: 300px;\n",
    "       border: 1px solid black;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`.container`**: This class is applied to the main container that holds your to-do list.\n",
    "   - **`width: 300px;`**: Sets the container's width to 300 pixels, making sure the entire to-do list fits within this size.\n",
    "   - **`border: 1px solid black;`**: Adds a black border around the container, giving it a defined edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **In simple terms**: The `.container` class creates a box that is 300 pixels wide with a black border around it, making the to-do list look neat and contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Styling the Input Area Container**:\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   .mainInputContainer {\n",
    "       width: 100%;\n",
    "       margin: 20px 0;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`.mainInputContainer`**: This class is applied to the container that holds the input field where you type new tasks.\n",
    "   - **`width: 100%;`**: Makes the container take up the full width of its parent container.\n",
    "   - **`margin: 20px 0;`**: Adds 20 pixels of space above and below the input container, separating it from other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **In simple terms**: The `.mainInputContainer` class ensures that the area around the input box has some space and stretches across the full width of the to-do list box.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Styling the Input Box**:\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   .mainInput {\n",
    "       padding: 5px;\n",
    "       border: 1px solid black;\n",
    "       margin: auto;\n",

    "       height: 40px;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`.mainInput`**: This class is applied to the input box where you type new tasks.\n",
    "   - **`padding: 5px;`**: Adds some space inside the input box between the text you type and the edges of the box.\n",
    "   - **`border: 1px solid black;`**: Adds a black border around the input box, making it look like a field you can type in.\n",
    "   - **`margin: auto;`**: Centers the input box within its container.\n",
    "   - **`display: block;`**: Ensures the input box behaves like a block element, taking up space on its own line.\n",
    "   - **`width: 260px;`**: Sets the input box’s width to 260 pixels, making it slightly narrower than the main container.\n",
    "   - **`height: 40px;`**: Sets the height of the input box to 40 pixels, giving it enough room for text.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **In simple terms**: The `.mainInput` class makes the input box where you type tasks look neat, centered, and easy to type in, with a black border and padding inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Styling the Filter Section**:\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   .filters {\n",
    "       display: flex;\n",
    "       justify-content: space-between;\n",
    "       padding: 20px;\n",
    "       margin-top: 20px;\n",
    "       border-top: 1px solid black;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`.filters`**: This class is applied to the section with buttons for filtering tasks (e.g., showing all, completed, or active tasks).\n",
    "   - **`display: flex;`**: Makes the filter buttons align in a row.\n",
    "   - **`justify-content: space-between;`**: Spreads the filter buttons evenly across the width of the section.\n",
    "   - **`padding: 20px;`**: Adds 20 pixels of space inside the filter section, giving the buttons some breathing room.\n",
    "   - **`margin-top: 20px;`**: Adds 20 pixels of space above the filter section, separating it from the tasks list.\n",
    "   - **`border-top: 1px solid black;`**: Adds a black line at the top of the filter section, giving it a clear boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **In simple terms**: The `.filters` class organizes the filter buttons in a row, spaces them out evenly, and adds a line above to separate them from the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Styling the Filter Buttons**:\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   .filterBtn {\n",
    "       background: none;\n",
    "       border: none;\n",
    "       cursor: pointer;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`.filterBtn`**: This class is applied to each filter button.\n",
    "   - **`background: none;`**: Removes the default button background.\n",
    "   - **`border: none;`**: Removes the default button border.\n",
    "   - **`cursor: pointer;`**: Changes the mouse cursor to a pointer when hovering over the button, indicating it’s clickable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **In simple terms**: The `.filterBtn` class makes the filter buttons look simple, without borders or background, and ensures that they’re clickable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Styling the Active Filter Button**:\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   .filterActive {\n",
    "       text-decoration: underline;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`.filterActive`**: This class is applied to the currently active filter button (the one that is selected).\n",
    "   - **`text-decoration: underline;`**: Adds an underline to the active button’s text to indicate it’s selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **In simple terms**: The `.filterActive` class makes the active filter button stand out by underlining its text, so you know which filter is currently applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- **`.container`**: Creates a neat, bordered box for your to-do list.\n",
    "- **`.mainInputContainer`**: Organizes and spaces the area for the input box.\n",
    "- **`.mainInput`**: Styles the input box where you type tasks, making it easy to use.\n",
    "- **`.filters`**: Lays out the filter buttons in a row and separates them from the tasks list.\n",
    "- **`.filterBtn`**: Simplifies the look of the filter buttons and makes them clickable.\n",
    "- **`.filterActive`**: Underlines the currently selected filter button to highlight it.\n",
    "\n",

    "This code in the `styles/todo.module.css` file is responsible for styling different parts of a single task in your to-do list app. Each part of the code makes sure that the input field for the task, the row layout, and the delete button look and work nicely. Let’s break down what each part does in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Styling the Task Input Field**:\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   .todoInput {\n",
    "       padding: 5px;\n",
    "       border: 1px solid black;\n",
    "       width: 194px;\n",
    "       height: 40px;\n",
    "       margin: 5px;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`.todoInput`**: This class is applied to the input box where you type or edit the task's name.\n",
    "   - **`padding: 5px;`**: Adds some space inside the input box, between the text and the edges of the box.\n",
    "   - **`border: 1px solid black;`**: Adds a thin black border around the input box, making it look like a defined field.\n",
    "   - **`width: 194px;`**: Sets the width of the input box to 194 pixels.\n",
    "   - **`height: 40px;`**: Sets the height of the input box to 40 pixels, making it tall enough for easy typing.\n",
    "   - **`margin: 5px;`**: Adds 5 pixels of space outside the input box, separating it slightly from other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **In simple terms**: The `.todoInput` class makes sure the input box for typing or editing tasks looks neat, with some space inside and around it, and a clear border to define its edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Styling the Row That Holds the Task**:\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   .toDoRow {\n",
    "       display: flex;\n",
    "       flex-direction: row;\n",
    "       align-items: center;\n",
    "       margin: 5px 20px;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`.toDoRow`**: This class is applied to the container that holds all the elements of a single task (like the checkbox, text input, and delete button).\n",
    "   - **`display: flex;`**: Arranges the elements inside the container in a flexible row, making them line up horizontally.\n",
    "   - **`flex-direction: row;`**: Ensures that the elements are arranged in a row (from left to right).\n",
    "   - **`align-items: center;`**: Aligns the elements vertically in the center, making sure they line up nicely.\n",
    "   - **`margin: 5px 20px;`**: Adds some space around the row: 5 pixels on the top and bottom, and 20 pixels on the left and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **In simple terms**: The `.toDoRow` class organizes everything in a single task into a neat horizontal line, making sure the checkbox, text input, and delete button are aligned and spaced out properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Styling the Delete Button**:\n",
    "   ```css\n",
    "   .deleteBtn {\n",
    "       background: none;\n",
    "       border: 0;\n",
    "       cursor: pointer;\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`.deleteBtn`**: This class is applied to the button that deletes a task.\n",
    "   - **`background: none;`**: Removes any background color or image from the button, making it look plain.\n",
    "   - **`border: 0;`**: Removes the border around the button, so it doesn’t look like a typical button.\n",
    "   - **`cursor: pointer;`**: Changes the mouse cursor to a pointer (a hand icon) when hovering over the button, indicating that it’s clickable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **In simple terms**: The `.deleteBtn` class makes the delete button look simple and clean, without a background or border, and ensures it’s clear that you can click it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- **`.todoInput`**: Styles the input box for typing or editing a task, giving it some padding, a border, and a proper size.\n",
    "- **`.toDoRow`**: Arranges all elements of a task (like checkbox, text input, delete button) in a horizontal line, making sure they’re well-aligned and spaced out.\n",
    "- **`.deleteBtn`**: Makes the delete button look simple and ensures it’s easy to recognize as clickable.\n",
    "\n",
    "These styles help make each task in your to-do list look organized and easy to interact with, contributing to a clean and user-friendly interface."

    "Uploading your backend application to a GitHub account is a relatively straightforward process. Here's a step-by-step guide to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create a Repository on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and make sure you're registered or log in.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a New Repository**:\n",
    "   - Click on the \"+\" icon in the top right corner and select \"New repository\".\n",
    "   - Name your repository, add a description (optional), and choose whether it should be public or private.\n",
    "   - You can also initialize the repository with a README file, a license, or a `.gitignore`, although this is optional and can be done later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Prepare Your Local Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Organize Your Code Locally**:\n",
    "   - If you haven't already, organize your code in a folder on your computer. Ensure everything you need is included and that confidential files (like `.env` with credentials) are excluded or listed in `.gitignore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize Git in Your Project** (if not already done):\n",
    "   - Open a terminal or command line.\n",
    "   - Navigate (`cd`) to your project folder.\n",
    "   - Run `git init` to initialize a new Git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add a `.gitignore` File** (if you don't have one):\n",
    "   - Create a `.gitignore` file at the root of your project.\n",
    "   - Add names of files or folders you don't want to upload to GitHub (for example, `node_modules`, sensitive configuration files, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Upload Your Code to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add Files to the Local Git Repository**:\n",
    "   - From the terminal, in your project folder, run `git add .` to add all files to the repository (respecting `.gitignore`).\n",
    "   - Or use `git add [file]` to add specific files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make Your First Commit**:\n",
    "   - Run `git commit -m \"First commit\"` to make the first commit with a descriptive message.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Link Your Local Repository with GitHub**:\n",
    "   - On GitHub, on your repository page, you'll find a URL for the repository. It will be something like `https://github.com/your-user/your-repository.git`.\n",
    "   - In your terminal, run `git remote add origin [repository URL]` to link your local repository with GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Push Your Code to GitHub**:\n",
    "   - Run `git push -u origin master` (or `main` if your main branch is called `main`) to push your code to the GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Verify and Continue Development\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Verify on GitHub**: After uploading your code, go to your repository page on GitHub to make sure everything is there.\n",
    "- **Future Development**: For future commits, you only need to do `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.\n",
    "\n",
    "And with that, your backend application should be on GitHub. Always remember to keep sensitive data secure and use good Git practices for managing your code."

    "Deploying your FastAPI backend with a PostgreSQL database on Render.com involves several steps. Render offers a fairly straightforward solution for deploying web applications and databases. Here is a basic guide to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Prepare Your FastAPI Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deploying, make sure your FastAPI application is production-ready. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary dependencies are listed in a `requirements.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Application Configuration**: Verify that your application is configured to use environment variables for important configurations, such as database credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dockerfile (Optional)**: If you prefer to deploy using Docker, make sure you have a suitable `Dockerfile` for your application. Render supports deployments both with and without Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Set Up Your PostgreSQL Database\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Database on Render**:\n",
    "   - Go to the Render dashboard and create a new PostgreSQL database service.\n",
    "   - Render will provide the database credentials, including the hostname, port, username, password, and database name.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configure Environment Variables**:\n",
    "   - Note down the database credentials, as you will need them to configure your FastAPI application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Deploy Your FastAPI Application\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a New Web Service on Render**:\n",
    "   - In the Render dashboard, choose the option to create a new web service.\n",
    "   - Select the repository where your FastAPI code is.\n",
    "   - Configure the deployment options, such as the runtime environment (if you are not using Docker).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Environment Variables for FastAPI**:\n",
    "   - In your web service settings on Render, set the necessary environment variables for your application, including the PostgreSQL database credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deployment**:\n",
    "   - Render will start the deployment process once you have configured your service and saved the changes.\n",
    "   - If you have set up everything correctly, Render will build and deploy your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Review and Testing**:\n",
    "   - After deploying, be sure to review the available logs in Render to verify that everything is working as expected.\n",
    "   - Perform tests to ensure that your FastAPI application is communicating correctly with the PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Updates and Maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Updates**: To update your application, simply push your changes to the repository connected to Render. Render will automatically initiate a new deployment.\n",
    "- **Monitor Your Application**: Use Render's tools to monitor the performance and health of your application and database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security**: Ensure that your application and database are configured securely.\n",
    "- **Database Backups**: Set up regular backups for your database on Render to prevent data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Render.com greatly facilitates the process of deploying applications and databases, integrating well with code repositories and providing a manageable platform for deployment and application management."

    "\n",
    "2. **Add New Environment Variables**:\n",
    "   - Click the button to add a new environment variable.\n",
    "   - Enter the name and value for each required variable.\n",
    "   - For example, if your FastAPI application uses environment variables for database connection, you will need to add variables such as `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_USER`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, etc., with the corresponding values you obtained when setting up your PostgreSQL database in Render.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Examples of Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`DATABASE_URL`**: The full URL to connect to your PostgreSQL database.\n",
    "- **`DATABASE_USER` and `DATABASE_PASSWORD`**: Username and password for the database.\n",
    "- **Application Configuration Variables**: Any other variables your application needs for its configuration, such as secret keys, operation modes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Save and Apply Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "- After adding all your environment variables, make sure to save the changes.\n",
    "- Render might automatically restart your service to apply these changes. If not, you can manually restart the service to ensure the new environment variables are in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Verify Everything Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once your service restarts with the new variables, verify that your application is running correctly and can connect to the database using the configured environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly configuring environment variables is crucial for the security and correct functioning of your application in production.

    "#### 1. Check the Application Logs\n",
    "\n",
    "After deploying your application and setting up the environment variables, the first thing to do is check the application's logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On Render.com, go to the dashboard of your web service.\n",
    "- Look for a logs or records section. This will show you the output of your application, including startup messages and errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. Perform Connectivity Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "If your FastAPI application exposes endpoints that perform read/write operations on the database, you can test these endpoints to ensure that the database connection is working properly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a tool like Postman or simply a browser to make requests to your API endpoints that require access to the database.\n",
    "- Observe if the operations are completed successfully (for example, reading data, creating new records, updating or deleting existing records).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Verify Application Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "If your application has a user interface (frontend):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interact with the application as a normal user would.\n",
    "- Perform actions that you know depend on the database and observe if they behave as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Check Security Configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure that your database's security configurations allow connections from your application deployed on Render. This may include setting up allowed IPs or adjusting firewall rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Use Diagnostic Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have access to database diagnostic or monitoring tools (like those provided by Render's database service or external tools), use them to verify if there are active connections and if queries are being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Consult Documentation and Support\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you encounter problems, consult the documentation of Render and FastAPI to see if there are specific configuration or troubleshooting steps you might have overlooked.\n",
    "- If problems persist, consider seeking help in community forums or Render's technical support.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Verify Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure the environment variables are correctly configured in Render and that your application is using them as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you should get a good idea of whether your application is running correctly and if it's connecting to the database as expected."

    "1. **Log in to Vercel**: Log into your Vercel account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import Your Project**:\n",
    "   - In your Vercel dashboard, look for an option to \"Import Project\" or \"New Project\".\n",
    "   - Select \"Import from GitHub\". Vercel will ask for permission to access your GitHub repositories if it's your first time doing this.\n",
    "   - Choose the GitHub repository that contains your frontend project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Configure Your Project in Vercel\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have selected your repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configure Project Options**:\n",
    "   - Vercel will automatically detect that it's a frontend project (such as a React, Vue, Next.js project, etc.) and will suggest configurations.\n",
    "   - Configure the build and deployment options as necessary. This may include build commands, output directory, and environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up Environment Variables** (if necessary):\n",
    "   - If your application requires environment variables (like API keys or URLs), add them in the project configuration on Vercel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Deploy Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "- After configuring your project, click on \"Deploy\". Vercel will start the deployment process automatically.\n",
    "- You can follow the progress of the deployment in the Vercel dashboard. Once the deployment is complete, you will receive a URL where your application will be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Future Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "- For future updates, simply push your changes to the GitHub repository. If you have continuous integrations enabled in Vercel, each push to the selected branch (such as `main` or `master`) will automatically initiate a new deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: Verify Your Application\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once your application is deployed, visit the URL provided by Vercel to ensure everything is working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "And with that, your frontend should be live on Vercel, accessible via a public URL, and automatically updating with each change you push to your GitHub repository."

    "To ensure that your frontend deployed on Vercel connects with your backend hosted on Render.com, you need to update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable to point to the URL of your backend service on Render.com. Here's how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Find Your Backend URL on Render\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log in to Render**: Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/) and log into your account.\n",
    "2. **Locate Your Backend Service**: Look for the service you have set up for your FastAPI backend.\n",
    "3. **Copy the Service URL**: Render assigns a URL to each deployed service. Find this URL in the dashboard of your service on Render. Typically, it will be something like `https://your-backend.onrender.com`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update the Environment Variable in Vercel\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log in to Vercel**: Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and log into your account.\n",
    "2. **Navigate to Your Frontend Project**: Search for and select the frontend project where you need to update the environment variable.\n",
    "3. **Access Project Settings**: Look for a configuration or settings section of the project.\n",
    "4. **Edit the Environment Variables**:\n",
    "   - Find the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` variable and change its value to the URL of your backend service on Render, for example, `https://your-backend.onrender.com`.\n",
    "   - If the variable does not exist, add it with the name `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and the corresponding value for the URL of the Render service.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recompilation**: When changing environment variables in Next.js projects, you may need to recompile your application for the changes to take effect.\n",
    "- **Public Variables in Next.js**: In Next.js, environment variables exposed to the browser must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Ensure this convention is maintained so your frontend application can access them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frontend Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have updated the environment variable in Vercel, your frontend application will automatically recompile and deploy with the new configuration.\n",
    "- Verify that your frontend is correctly connecting to the backend after deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, your frontend on Vercel will be configured to communicate with your backend hosted on Render.com, allowing you to effectively handle requests between the frontend and backend."
